# TextureFont for Godot 4.2 (WIP)

This port of the addon was initially made tailored specifically to my project.
However, I feel like the public would benefit from it as well.

> [!NOTE]  
> This port uses a very hacky solution which causes errors on every save.
> This is not easily avoidable until https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/82254 is addressed.
